This view provides basic information on relation size.  Catalogs and tables
in the information schema are exclused, as are TOAST tables.

The inclusive metrics show the relation along with indexes and TOAST.  The 
exclusiove metrics show without these things.  The bytes metrics are intended
for graph drawing, while the sizes are there for administrators who want to
quickly query this information and make decisions.

COMMENT ON VIEW relation_toast_size IS
$$
This measures the amount of space in a relation's TOAST tables.  These are 
populated when data exceeds what can be reasonably stored inline in the main
heap pages.  You would expect to see this non-zero where you have large fields
being stored, particularly arrays of composite types.

Performance-wise moving data to TOAST improves sequential scans where the data
is not required (count(*) for example) at the cost of making the data that has 
been moved far more expensive to retrieve and process.

This provides database-cluster-wide statistics on disk usage by tablespace.

Note that tablespaces and databases are orthogonal.  Typically if you are 
running out of disk space, you want to check this one first, then database_size
and then the size of the relations in the largest database in that order.

This gives you the number of connections (cluster-wide) by state (active, idle, 
idle in transaction, etc).  If the query is active but is waiting on a lock or

COMMENT ON TABLE pg_telemetry_wal_log IS $$
This table logs the times and results of wal telemetry readings so that
deltas can be calculated.  At least one row must be present to get any useful
data out of the wal_telemetry() function at all.

If you get one telemetry entry a minute, over the course of a year you will get
just over half a million entries.  These are indexed on both epoch and timestamp
so access is not impaired, but if you want ot purge, be careful to leave at
least one entry at the end.

You can also process these as a time series using WINDOW functions like lag.

select wal_telemetry();

comment on function wal_telemetry() is $$
The wal_telemetry() function checks the current wal location and compares
with the last entry in the pg_telemetry_wal_log.  It then provides for you
both current and last data, and the differences between them.  These include
bytes elapsed and seconds elapsed, and bytes per sec.

The function is designed so that you can export delta information to a monitoring
solution such as munin or prometheus without the latter having to know anything
about lsn representation or losing information in the process.

On a replica this does not write to the table and measures deltas from the last
this was written on the master.

COMMENT ON VIEW replication_slot_lag IS
$$
This view monitors lag on downstream slots.  It compares the last sent wal 
segment to the current known wal location.

For master database, the current wal location is self-explanatory.  For replicas
we use the last received WAL location instead.  Note that replicas can have 
replication slots for downstream replication tracking.
